## Step 2: Remotely Connecting

```
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
Type in yes and enter your password. Your terminal shoud look as follows ![Image](loggedin.png)
You are now connected to a remote server!

## Step 3: Trying Some Commands

Now that you are connected to the remote server, you can try running certain commands. Here is a list of commands for you to try on the remote server as well as your own computer:
* `cd`
* `cd ~`
* `ls -a`
* `ls -lat`
* `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt`

Here is an example of what the command `ls -lat` would look like on the remote server. ![Image](command.png)
